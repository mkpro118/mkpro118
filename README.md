# üëã Hey there, I'm M K!

## üöÄ About Me

I'm a recent graduate with a B.S. in Computer Sciences from the
University of Wisconsin-Madison. My passion lies in building things that help
people, which is why I fell in love with software development in the first
place. There's an immense joy in creating solutions that make a difference!

My favorite fields are:

- üß† Artificial Intelligence (especially Deep Neural Networks)
- üíª Low Level Systems Programming (I absolutely loved my Operating Systems and
Computer Networks classes!)
- ü§ñ Automation of tasks with scripts (because if it can be automated,
it should be!)

## üõ† Skills

### Programming Languages (in order of how much I love them)

1. ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)
2. ![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/c-%2300599C.svg?style=flat&logo=c&logoColor=white)
3. ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=flat&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E)
4. ![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/rust-%23000000.svg?style=flat&logo=rust&logoColor=orange)
5. ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=flat&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white)

### Tools & Technologies I enjoy working with

- ![scikit-learn](https://img.shields.io/badge/scikit--learn-%23F7931E.svg?style=flat&logo=scikit-learn&logoColor=white), ![SciPy](https://img.shields.io/badge/SciPy-%230C55A5.svg?style=flat&logo=scipy&logoColor=%white), and ![NumPy](https://img.shields.io/badge/numpy-%23013243.svg?style=flat&logo=numpy&logoColor=white) (the holy trinity of data science)
- ![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/docker-%230db7ed.svg?style=flat&logo=docker&logoColor=white) ([Docker compose watch](https://docs.docker.com/compose/file-watch/) is a lifesaver)
- ![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/git-%23F05033.svg?style=flat&logo=git&logoColor=white) (I absolutely adore Git! It's like magic ‚ú®)
- ![PyTorch](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyTorch-%23EE4C2C.svg?style=flat&logo=PyTorch&logoColor=white) (TensorFlow is cool too)
- ![Flask](https://img.shields.io/badge/flask-%23000.svg?style=flat&logo=flask&logoColor=white) & ![Django](https://img.shields.io/badge/django-%23092E20.svg?style=flat&logo=django&logoColor=white) (web dev is fun!)
- ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=flat&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)

## üî≠ Current Projects

- [Regex Engine](https://github.com/mkpro118/Regex-Engine):
A simple regex engine built from scratch in C. Why? Because I love
understanding how things work under the hood!
No high-level libraries here, just pure C goodness.
- [GreekoSystem](https://github.com/greekosystem):
An ecosystem for Greek life executive management. We're making communication
and organization in fraternities and sororities a breeze!
Version 1 coming out July 25th, 2024 üéâ

## üå± I'm currently geeking out on

- Retrieval Augmented Generation with Vector Databases (sounds fancy, right?)
- React Server Components and Streaming UI Components (the future of web dev!)
- Various AI SDKs (because one can never know too much about AI)
- Lexer Generators and Parser Generators (I want to make a parser generator
from context-free grammar rules. JavaCUP, watch out!)

## üè´ Cool Stuff I Built at UW-Madison

- A Neural Network Library from scratch (numpy and scipy were my only friends)
[[see source]](https://github.com/mkpro118/neural_network)
- A Genetic Algorithm Library (with just numpy - talk about minimalism!)
[[see source]](https://github.com/mkpro118/GeneticAlgorithm)
- A Computational Graph Library (numpy for the win, again)
[[see source]](https://github.com/mkpro118/ComputationalGraph)
- Chess Piece Detection project (combining my love for neural networks and chess)
[[see source]](https://github.com/mkpro118/Chess-Piece-Detection)
- A WhatsApp clone using Django (because why not?)
[[see source]](https://github.com/mkpro118/my-whatsapp)

## üíº Work Experience

While I'm yet to step into the professional world, I've got a solid foundation
from my Software Engineering class at UW-Madison (one of my favorites!).
I'm on the lookout for opportunities where I can build useful things and help
people.

## üé® A Bit More About Me

I'm not just interested in using AI models - I love building and training them
myself. Anyone can use a pre-trained model, but the real fun is in creating
something from scratch!

When it comes to systems programming, I'm all about the software side.
Hardware is cool, but software is where the magic happens for me.

And remember, in my world, if something can be automated, it probably should be.
